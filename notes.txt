"There was an idea called something unimportant. The idea was to bring together
a group of remarkable people (read: 2 remarkable people and an absolute
amateur), see if they could become something more. See if they could work
together when they felt like it to make some really shiny things."

Project Carbon is a plan to investigate and develop a system for locally
controlled RGB LEDs for the eventual purpose of producing a real version
of Joy's mask from Payday 2.

Goals of Carbon:
  Create a script/device image which runs on a raspberry pi zero w
    This hardware was selected based on wireless capability and size
      wireless for resons detailed below

      size as Carbon is meant to be implementable in a variety of form factors
      the chip is small, making mounting trivial

  Enable the device to act as a local access point while also running
  a set of lights

  Enable the device to respond, likely via http requests, to remote control
  via the aforementioned access point
    if using http requests, flask seems like a good way to receive requests

    for initial testing, perhaps have a set of pregenerated patterns that the
    user can select from via requests
      e.g "red" for red, etc.

  Enable the remote user to adjust the color of lights

Stretch goals
  Create an android app to allow easy mobile configuration of lights

  Create a pattern editor (in the app) to allow for easy configuration
